* Run the .tcl script to generate a Vivado project containing all the IPs and the block design. 
* The generated project will be called "debayering_filter_zybo".
* Use the .xsa file to create a Vitis application project and insert the application source code.
* NOTE: Vivado should be opened in the same directory as the **.tcl** file.
